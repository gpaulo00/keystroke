# KeyStroke
KeyStroke is a **serverless** credential manager, that stores your keys
using **Web Storage** technologies.

## Prerequisites
You must have some things before you can run this:
- Node
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored
in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running the tests
To execute the *unit* tests (via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)),
you should run:
```sh
ng test
```

To execute the *end-to-end* tests (via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/)),
you should run:
```sh
ng e2e
```
